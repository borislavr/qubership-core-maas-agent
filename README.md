global MaaS and stores it to secret.

* `MAAS_INTERNAL_ADDRESS` - Optional, but if you don't set it properly you can't work with MaaS solution, default will be used. See description below.
* `MAAS_AGENT_NAMESPACE_ISOLATION_ENABLED` - Optional. If false, microservice can request for topics by classifier with any namespace ignoring composite rules.
